# Medication-Tracking-System-ASP.NET
There may be some medications to track, there will be weight to be entered into the diary, and the Health Report will be useful when talking to his or her doctor. One final use case (that I am specifying - there are a number of other possible use cases) is for the individual that is away from home when a health event occurs. They will have their recent health information at hand for the emergency room physician, including what medications they are taking. Once they are released, the Pharmacy Lookup tool will help them identify where the nearest pharmacy is so that they can fill their prescriptions and get back to their vacation with a minimum of fuss. They can even use the Health Data to let their regular doctor know about their health event
